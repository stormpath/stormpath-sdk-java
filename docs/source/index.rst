Stormpath Servlet Plugin
========================

The Stormpath Servlet Plugin is a drop-in plugin for web applications deployed to a `Servlet`_ container, like Tomcat or Jetty.  It makes it *incredibly* simple to add user management, authentication and authorization to your application.

The plugin helps automate all user registration, login, authentication and authorization workloads as well as properly secure the web app.  It is very flexible - use only what you need or leverage the entire feature set.

And the best part? **You don't even need a database!**
